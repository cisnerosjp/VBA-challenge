## The Task
This assignment required the use of VBA in order to analyze generated stock market data. We were required to create scripts that looped through the stocks for each of the three years provided: 2018 - 2020. In the loops we had to read the ticker symbol, the yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of each year and the closing price at the end of that year, the percentage change from the opening price, and more.

## Navigating this repository
You can find a the code and excel worksheet for this repository in the resources folder. You can find the vba code saved individually as CLS files, one for each worksheet. The images requested are in the images folder.

## Data Provided
For this tasks we were provided starter code that had a smaller worksheet that we could make sure that our code worked correctly on prior to using that code on the larger workbook as it took a long time to run the code with changes on the larger workbook. You can find the completed workbook in the Resources folder. 

## Code Sources
The code in this repository was sourced from starter code provided by the bootcamp as well as from in-class work and activities, stack overflow, and documentation libraries for VBA for certain aspects of this challenge.
